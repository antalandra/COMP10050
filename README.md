CONTRIBUTION TO ASSIGNMENT #2:

ANDRA ANTAL (18314246):
--> created the repository
--> Wrote function check_if_chosen to ensure two players don't choose the same color token 
-->implemented function in initialise_players
-->started to call functions to print the board and move tokens on the board
-->changed obstacle to normal function 
-->attempted implementation of obstacle to normal function into play_game
-->changed play_game into a type int function to ensure it terminates when winner is found
-->added function to check winner of the game and implemented function into play_game
--> added randomisation
-->added obstacle checking into sideways move
-->fixed play_game function entirely
-->perfected fairness function
--> commenting

DAIANA MORJOLIC (18303531):
-> implementing the code skeleton
-->Game_init.c -> initialising players with name and colors (beginning the write up for the initialize_players
-->game_logic.c -> place_tokens -> filling the token placement on column 0
-->color_name - function to return the name of a color from an enum color type
-->move_token
-->began the writing of function that checks if an obstacle should still be an obstacle square
--> added to play_game function to complete sideways move and forward move
-->continued work on turning obstacle squares into normal squares
-->added function prototypes for fairness and implemented them into place_tokens
--> commenting

Most of the work was written on Daiana's laptop due to better performance, so although the work was split and uploaded fairly, we both worked on all functions and their implementation. As such, we have completed the entire project together.
